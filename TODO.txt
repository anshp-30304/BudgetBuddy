### Development Plan Functionalities with MongoDB and Node.js/Express

#### Phase 1: Core Functionality (2-3 Weeks)
1. **User Authentication (JWT-based)**
   - Use `jsonwebtoken` library to issue JWT tokens.
   - Store encrypted passwords using `bcryptjs`.
   - Implement login, registration, and session handling using Express routes.

2. **Database Schema Creation with MongoDB**
   - Define MongoDB collections (noSQL schema):
     - **Users Collection**: Stores user details (email, hashed password, currency preference).
     - **Expenses Collection**: Stores expense data (amount, category, description, date).
     - **Categories Collection**: Optionally store predefined categories for expenses.
   
   Use **Mongoose** to define schemas and models for these collections.

3. **CRUD Operations for Expense Management**
   - Implement API routes for:
     - Create, read, update, and delete expenses.
     - Category management (optional).

#### Phase 2: Dashboard and Reports (2-3 Weeks)
4. **Dashboard with Data Visualizations**
   - Use **Chart.js** on the front-end (React or another framework) to visualize expenses.
   - Create API endpoints to aggregate data (e.g., total expenses by category, date range).

5. **Filters for Data**
   - Implement API filtering endpoints based on:
     - Date range, category, and amount ranges.
     - Use MongoDB queries with `.find()` and `.aggregate()` for efficient filtering.

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features (2 Weeks)
6. **CSV Export Functionality**
   - Create an Express route that allows users to export their expense data in CSV format using the **json2csv** package.
   
7. **Multi-Currency Conversion**
   - Use an external API (like **Fixer.io** or **CurrencyLayer**) to fetch real-time exchange rates and convert expenses based on the user’s preferred currency.

8. **Unit and Integration Testing**
   - Use **Jest** and **Supertest** for writing unit and integration tests for the Express routes.
   - Test authentication, CRUD operations, and data aggregation.

#### Phase 4: Deployment and Testing (1-2 Weeks)
9. **Host the App on a Cloud Platform**
   - Deploy the app on **Heroku** or **AWS**.
   - Set up **Mongoose** to connect to a cloud-based MongoDB instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).

10. **Monitor Performance and Fix Bugs**
    - Use monitoring tools like **LogRocket** or **New Relic** to track errors and performance issues.
    - Optimize database queries and improve API response times.

#### Extra Features (Add Later)
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Ensure the web app is responsive using CSS frameworks like **Bootstrap** or **TailwindCSS**. Alternatively, build a React Native mobile app.
- **Budget Management**: Add a "budgets" collection in MongoDB and implement budget tracking features.
- **Recurring Expenses**: Create a recurring expense logic with cron jobs in Node.js.
- **Sharing & Collaboration**: Allow multiple users to share an account using MongoDB’s embedded documents or references.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Integrate a machine learning API or use data analysis to provide insights on spending habits.

This plan integrates MongoDB effectively, focusing on a flexible data structure, and provides easy scalability for the future.
